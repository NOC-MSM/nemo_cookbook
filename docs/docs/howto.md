# A Quickstart Guide to Common Operations with NEMODataTree

In this section, we describe some of the most common `NEMODataTree` operations in a concise how-to guide (inspired by the excellent documentation of [**Icechunk**](https://icechunk.io/en/latest/howto/)).

For more detailed documentation on each of the `NEMODataTree` methods, user should visit the [API].

### Create a NEMODataTree from Local Files

We can create a `NEMODataTree` from a dictionary of paths to local netCDF files using the `.from_paths()` constructor:

```python
paths = {"parent": {
         "domain": "/path/to/domain_cfg.nc",
         "gridT": "path/to/*_gridT.nc",
         "gridU": "path/to/*_gridV.nc",
         "gridV": "path/to/*_gridV.nc",
         "gridW": "path/to/*_gridW.nc",
         "icemod": "path/to/*_icemod.nc",
        },
        }

NEMODataTree.from_paths(paths, iperio=True, nftype="T")
```

In the example above, we consider only a global parent domain, which is zonally periodic (`iperio=True`) and north-folding on **T** grid points (`nftype="T"`). Note, that we are only required to specify paths for one or more NEMO model grid types (e.g., `*_gridT.nc`).

### Create a NEMODataTree from `xarray.Datasets`

Alternatively, we can create a `NEMODataTree` from a dictionary of single or multi-file `xarray.Datasets`. This is particularly valuable when working with remote NEMO model data or Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) outputs which require us to reformat coordinate dimensions (see **Example NEMODataTrees**).

```python
ds_domain = xr.open_zarr("https://some_remote_data/domain_cfg.zarr")
ds_gridT = xr.open_zarr("https://some_remote_data/MY_MODEL_gridT.nc")

datasets = {"parent": {"domain": ds_domain, "gridT": ds_gridT}}

nemo = NEMODataTree.from_datasets(datasets=datasets)
```

This example would be applicable to the outputs of a regional NEMO model configuration which is neither zonally periodic nor north-folding (by default, `iperio=False` & `nftype=None`).

### Calculate Grid Cell Areas

To calculate the area of a model grid cell face, we can use the `.cell_area()` method.

For example, to compute the horizontal area of cells centered on **T** grid points in the parent domain:

```python
nemo.cell_area(grid="/gridT", dim="k")
```

Importantly, the `dim` argument represents the dimensional orthogonal to the grid cell area to be compute. For **T** grid points, this results in the following grid cell areas: 

| `dim`   | Grid Cell Area           |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `i`         | e2t * e3t             |
| `j`         | e1t * e3t        |
| `k`         | e1t * e2t        |

### Calculate Grid Cell Volumes

To calculate the volume of model grid cells, we can use the `.cell_volume()` method.

For example, to compute the volume of each grid cell centered on a **V** grid point in the model parent domain:

```python
nemo.cell_volumes(grid="/gridV")
```

### Clip a NEMO Model Grid

To clip a given model grid using a geographical bounding box defined by a tuple of the form (`lon_min`, `lon_max`, `lat_min`, `lat_max`), we can use the `.clip_grid()` method.

For example, to clip the parent T-grid in the bounding box (-80째E, 0째E, 40째N, 80째N):

```python
bbox = (-80, 0, 40, 80)

nemo.clip_grid(grid="/gridT", bbox=bbox)
```

### Clip a NEMO Model Domain

To clip all of the model grids of a given NEMO model domain:

```python
nemo.clip_domain(dom=".", bbox=bbox)
```

where `dom` is the prefix of the chosen NEMO model domain. Note `dom="."` for the parent domain.

### Calculate Horizontal Gradients

To calculate the gradient of a scalar variable `var` along one of the horizontal dimensions (e.g., `i`, `j`) of a given NEMO model grid, we can use the `.gradient()` method.

For example, to compute the 'meridional' gradient of sea surface temperature `tos_con` along the NEMO model parent domain `j` dimension:

```python
nemo.gradient(dom='.', var="tos_con", dim="j")
```

### Calculate Vertical Gradients

To calculate the vertical gradient of a scalar variable `var` along the `k` dimension of a given NEMO model grid, we can also use the `.gradient()` method.

For example, to compute the vertical gradient of absolute salinity in our first NEMO model nested child domain:

```python
nemo.gradient(dom="1", var="so_abs", dim="k")
```

### Calculate Divergence

To calculate the horizontal divergence from the `i` and `j` components of a vector field, we can use the `.divergence()` method.

For example, to compute the horizontal divergence from the seawater velocity field in the NEMO model parent domain:

```python
nemo.divergence(dom=".", vars=["uo", "vo"])
```

where `vars` is a list specifying the names of `i` and `j` vector components, respectively.

### Calculate Curl

To calculate the vertical `k` component of the curl of a horizontal vector field, we can use the `.curl()` method.

For example, to compute the vertical component of the curl of the seawater velocity field in the second NEMO nested child domain:

```python
nemo.curl(dom="2", vars=["uo", "vo"])
```

where, as in the case of `.divergence()`, the `vars` argument expects a list of the `i` anf `j` components of the vector field, respectively.

### Calculate Integrals

To integrate a variable along one or more dimensions of a given NEMO model grid, we can use the `.integral()` method.

For example, to compute the integral of conservative temperature `thetao_con` along the vertical `k` dimension in the NEMO model parent domain:

```python
nemo.integral(grid="/gridT", var="thetao_con", dims=["k"])
```

which will return an `xarray.DataArray` with one less dimension than `thetao_con`, in this case `k` since we have integrated vertically.

### Calculate Cumulative Integrals

We can also use the `.integral()` method to calculate cumulative integrals along one or more dimensions of a given NEMO model grid.

For example, to calculate the vertical meridional overturning stream function from the meridional velocity `vo` (*zonally integrated meridional velocity accumulated with increasing depth*):

```python
nemo.integral(grid="/gridV",
              var="vo",
              dims=["i", "k"], 
              cum_dims=["k"],
              dir="+1",
              )
```
where `dims` is a list of the names of all grid dimensions along which integration will be performed, and `cum_dims` specifies which of the dimensions in `dims` should be cumulatively integrated.

The `dir` argument is used to define the direction of cumulative integration, where `dir = "+1"` means accumulating along the chosen dimension, such that grid indices are increasing. Conversely, `dir = "-1"` means that cumulative integration is performed after reversing the chosen dimension, such that grid dimensions are decreasing.

Note, we can also pass the `mask` argument to `.integral()` to mask the variable `var` prior to performing the integration. 

### Create Regional Masks using Polygons

To define a regional mask using the geographical coordinates of a closed polygon, we can use the `.mask_with_polygon()` method:

```python
nemo.mask_with_polygon(grid="/gridT", lon_poly, lat_poly)
```

where `lon_poly` and `lat_poly` are lists or ndarrays containing the longitude and latitude coordinates defining the closed polygon.

### Calculate Statistics for a Region Masked using a Polygon

To calculate an aggregated statistic from only the model grid cells contained inside a geographical polygon, we can use the `.masked_statistic()` method.

For example, to compute the grid cell area-weighted mean sea surface temperature `tos_con` for a region enclosed in a polygon defined by `lon_poly` and `lat_poly` in a NEMO model nested child domain:

```python
nemo.masked_statistic(grid="/gridT/1_gridT",
                      var="tos_con",
                      lon_poly,
                      lat_poly,
                      statistic="weighted_mean",
                      dims=["i", "j"]
                      )
```

where `dims` represent the dimensions of the NEMO model grid used for aggregation. In this example, combining `statistic="weighted_mean"` and `dims=["i", "j"]` is equivalent to computing the mean of variable `tos_con` using the horizontal cell area of **T** grid points (i.e., e1t * e2t) as weights.

### Calculate Binned Statistics

To calculate aggregated statistics of a variable binned according to the values of one or more variables, we can use the `.binned_statistic()` method. 

This is a generalization of a histogram function, enabling the computation of the sum, mean, median, or other statistic of the values assigned to each bin.

For example, to compute the mean depth associated with each isopycnal in discrete potential density (`sigma0`) coordinates:

```python
sigma0_bins = np.arange(22, 29.05, 0.05)

nemo.binned_statistic(grid="/gridT",
                      vars=["sigma0"],
                      values="deptht",
                      keep_dims=["time_counter"],
                      bins=[sigma0_bins],
                      statistic="nanmean",
                      )
```

where `vars` is a list of the names of variables to be binned using the bin edges passed to `bins`, and `values` is the name of the variable over which the `statistic` will be performed once values have been grouped into each bin.

We can use `keep_dims` to specify the dimensions of the `xarray.DataArray` named `values` to retain. In the example above, using `keep_dims="time_counter"` will return the average depths of water in each potential density bin for each time-slice of available NEMO model output.

### Transform a Vertical Grid

To transform a variable defined on a given NEMO model vertical grid to a new vertical grid using conservative interpolation, we can use the `.transform_vertical_grid()` method.

For example, if we wanted to transform the conservative temperature variable `tos_con` defined in a NEMO model parent domain from it's native 75 unevenly-spaced z-levels to regulary spaced z-levels at 200 m intervals:

```python
e3t_target = xr.DataArray(np.repeat(200.0, 30), dims=['k_new'])

nemo.transform_vertical_grid(grid='/gridT',
                             var = 'thetao_con',
                             e3_new = e3t_target
                            )
```

where `e3_new` represents the time-invariant vertical grid cell thicknesses defing the vertical grid onto which the variable `var` will be conservatively interpolated. 

There are some important points to remember when transforming variables onto new vertical grids with `NEMODataTree`:

- New vertical grid cell thicknesses `e3_new` must sum to at least the maximum depth of the original vertical grid cell thicknesses (e.g., e3t).

- Currently, `e3_new` must be a 1-dimensional `xarray.DataArray` with dimension 'k_new'.

- The output `xarray.Dataset` will contain multi-dimensional `xarray.DataArrays` for both the vertically remapped variable `var(time_counter, k_new, j, i)` and the vertical grid cell thicknesses `e3t_new(time_counter, k_new, j, i)` (updated to explicitly account for partial grid cells above the seafloor).
